## Instructions

Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.

Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. We would love to see you show off your creativity!

The rubric contains the following two questions:

* Does the web page feature a date and is this date less than two months before the date that you're grading this assignment?
* Does the web page feature an interactive map that appears to have been created with Leaflet?

## Results

There are 10 random point on the map of Moscow city.

```{r}
library(leaflet)
coords=read.csv2("coords.csv", header=TRUE, dec=".", sep=",")

options(digits=7)
NamesLatLng <- data.frame(
    Name = coords$Name,
    lat = as.numeric(coords$Lat),
    lng = as.numeric(coords$Lng)
    )


leaflet(NamesLatLng) %>% addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(NamesLatLng$lng, NamesLatLng$lat, popup = paste(NamesLatLng$Name))
```
